# Temperature-control-using-PID
The objective of this experiment is to use a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to regulate the temperature of a conventional incandescent lightbulb. We use Simulink to model the PID Controller, extract proportional, integral, derivative gain constants and derive natural response and transfer function of the PID Controller.
